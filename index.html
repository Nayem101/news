		<h1>Donald Trump fires Wall St enforcer Preet Bharara, who refused to quit</h1>
		<p>Manhattan federal prosecutor Preet Bharara's refusal to step down after a call for his resignation set up a public battle with US President Donald Trump, who abruptly fired Wall Street's top enforcer on Saturday (Sunday NZT), months after asking him to remain in the post.

Bharara's firing came a day after Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked for the resignations of 46 US attorneys who were appointed by former president Barack Obama.
